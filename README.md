# Signal-System
## Computer Assignment 1

The project covers four main topics:

Part 1: Basic 2D plotting of sine and cosine functions.

Part 2: Linear system identification and parameter estimation from noisy data.

Part 3: Simulating a radar system to estimate distance using signal correlation.

Part 4: Basic audio processing, including changing the playback speed of a .wav file

## Computer Assignment 2


This computer assignment focused on image and video processing for vehicle recognition.

The project is divided into four main parts:

Part 1: Manually implementing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system from scratch to read English license plates. 

Part 2: Building an OCR system for Persian license plates, which requires creating a custom character database. 

Part 3: Detecting and isolating the license plate from a larger image of a car before performing character recognition. 

Part 4: Estimating a car's average speed by processing a short video clip of it moving. 

## Computer Assignment 3
This assignment covers steganography, image processing, and machine learning.

The project is divided into three main sections:

Part 1: Hiding and decoding a text message within a grayscale image using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.

Part 2: Implementing template matching using normalized cross-correlation to locate specific Integrated Circuits (ICs) on a PCB image.

Part 3: Using the MATLAB Classification Learner App to train and test a Linear SVM model for diabetes prediction.

## Computer Assignment 4
This project simulate a digital communication system using amplitude-shift keying (ASK).

The assignment involves:

Encoding: Creating a function (coding_amp) to convert an English text message into an analog signal by mapping binary data to different sine wave amplitudes.

Decoding: Building a corresponding function (decoding_amp) that uses correlation to retrieve the original message from the signal.

Noise Analysis: Investigating the system's performance by adding Gaussian noise to the signal.

Performance Trade-off: Simulating at different bit rates (1, 2, and 3 bits/sec) to analyze the relationship between transmission speed and noise immunity

## Computer Assignment 5
This project is about the Fourier Transform and its application in digital communication.

The project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: An introduction to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in MATLAB. It covers key concepts like frequency resolution, which depends on the signal's time duration (T), and the observable frequency range, which depends on the sampling rate (fs).

Part 2: A simulation of a digital communication system using Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK). Information is encoded by transmitting sine waves at different frequencies.
The simulation analyzes the system's robustness to noise at different bit rates (1 and 5 bits/sec).

## Computer Assignment 6
This project is about signal processing applications in radar and music synthesis.

The assignment consists of two main parts:

Part 1: Doppler Radar Simulation:
This section involves simulating a radar to determine the distance and velocity of one or more moving objects. The method relies on using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency shift (Doppler effect) and phase of the returned signal.

Part 2: Music Synthesis and Recognition:
This part focuses on creating a piece of music by generating a sequence of sine waves at specific note frequencies. It also requires developing a method to automatically analyze a given music file to identify the notes and their timings.
