# Signal-System
## Computer Assignment 1

The project covers four main topics:

Part 1: Basic 2D plotting of sine and cosine functions.

Part 2: Linear system identification and parameter estimation from noisy data.

Part 3: Simulating a radar system to estimate distance using signal correlation.

Part 4: Basic audio processing, including changing the playback speed of a .wav file

## Computer Assignment 2


This computer assignment focused on image and video processing for vehicle recognition.

The project is divided into four main parts:

Part 1: Manually implementing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system from scratch to read English license plates. 

Part 2: Building an OCR system for Persian license plates, which requires creating a custom character database. 

Part 3: Detecting and isolating the license plate from a larger image of a car before performing character recognition. 

Part 4: Estimating a car's average speed by processing a short video clip of it moving. 

## Computer Assignment 3
This assignment covers steganography, image processing, and machine learning.

The project is divided into three main sections:

Part 1: Hiding and decoding a text message within a grayscale image using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.

Part 2: Implementing template matching using normalized cross-correlation to locate specific Integrated Circuits (ICs) on a PCB image.

Part 3: Using the MATLAB Classification Learner App to train and test a Linear SVM model for diabetes prediction.
